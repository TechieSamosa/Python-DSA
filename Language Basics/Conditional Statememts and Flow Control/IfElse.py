#Sure, here's a Python code snippet that uses all the control statements (if, elif, else, for,
#while, break, continue, pass, and try...except) to demonstrate their usage:
# if statement
x = 10
if x > 5:
    print("x is greater than 5")
elif x == 5:
    print("x is equal to 5")
else:
    print("x is less than 5")

# for loop
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)

# while loop
i = 1
while i <= 5:
    print(i)
    i += 1

# break statement
for i in range(10):
    if i == 5:
        break
    print(i)

# continue statement
for i in range(5):
    if i == 2:
        continue
    print(i)

# pass statement
for i in range(5):
    pass

# try...except statement
try:
    print("variable_does_not_exist")
except NameError:
    print("Variable is not defined")
